# ConfigurableEnum

Make ActiveRecord `enum` configurable: store the mapping in database instead of hard code

**Only Support `Integer` Value Currently**

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'configurable_enum'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

1. Setup: Generate mapping model and migration:  
   `rails g configurable_enum:setup <model_column>`  
   For example, you want to make `Book`'s column `category` to be enum: `rails g configurable_enum:setup book_category`  
   It will Generate a model `BookCategroyMapping`
   
2. `rails db:migrate`
   
3. Declare in the model, like:
    ```ruby
    class Book < ActiveRecord
      configurable_enum :category
    end
    ```
    
4. You may want to init the enum mapping data, use:
    ```ruby
    hash = { science: 1 } # or { science: [1, 'remarks'] }
    Book.set_categories(hash)
    ```

That's all!

1. `Book.categories`
